# Matrix Calculator

This is a simple matrix calculator program written in C. It allows users to perform various operations on matrices, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, transpose, trace, determinant, and matrix exponentiation. The program provides an interactive command-line interface where users can input matrices and choose operations to perform.

## Features

- Addition of two matrices
- Subtraction of two matrices
- Multiplication of two matrices
- Transpose of a matrix
- Calculation of trace of a matrix
- Calculation of determinant of a matrix
- Exponentiation of a matrix (A^n or B^n)

## Getting Started

To use the matrix calculator, follow these steps:

1. Compile the source code using a C compiler (e.g., GCC).
2. Run the compiled executable file.
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to input matrices and select operations.

## Usage

When running the program, you will be prompted to enter the number of rows and columns for the matrices A and B. Then, you can input the elements of both matrices. After inputting the matrices, you can choose from the following operations:

- **Add Matrices (Option 1)**: Adds matrices A and B.
- **Subtract Matrices (Option 2)**: Subtracts matrix B from matrix A.
- **Multiply Matrices (Option 3)**: Multiplies matrices A and B.
- **Transpose Matrix A (Option 4)**: Transposes matrix A.
- **Transpose Matrix B (Option 5)**: Transposes matrix B.
- **Trace of Matrix A (Option 6)**: Calculates the trace of matrix A.
- **Trace of Matrix B (Option 7)**: Calculates the trace of matrix B.
- **Determinant of Matrix A (Option 8)**: Calculates the determinant of matrix A.
- **Determinant of Matrix B (Option 9)**: Calculates the determinant of matrix B.
- **Multiply of A^n (Option 10)**: Calculates the exponentiation of matrix A to the power of n.
- **Multiply of B^n (Option 11)**: Calculates the exponentiation of matrix B to the power of n.
